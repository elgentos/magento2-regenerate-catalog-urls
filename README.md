## FAQ

### What's the difference between url_key and url_path?
`url_key` contains the key, like `joust-duffle-bag` for the product "Joust Duffle Bag". The `url_path` is generated by taking the `url_key` and adding the suffix (which for products is stored in `catalog/seo/product_url_suffix` and defaults to `.html`). So the `url_path` would by default become `joust-duffle-bag.html`. It also adds the category slugs of the parent categories so the `url_path` might become `bags/joust-duffle-bag.html`. However, the use of `url_path` has been deprecated since early Magento 2.1 versions (see [here](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9113)). If you are running on a recent Magento 2 version, you can safely delete those values by running `DELETE FROM catalog_product_entity_varchar WHERE attribute_id = (SELECT attribute_id FROM eav_attribute WHERE attribute_code = 'url_path' AND entity_type_id = 4)`.

URL paths are still used in categories though, so don't remove those.

### Why am I getting a 'Duplicated url' warning when running the command?
If you see this error, you have duplicate `url_key` values (within a store) in `catalog_product_entity_varchar`. You can use this extension to check those (and you need to fix them manually): [baldwin/magento2-module-url-data-integrity-checker](https://github.com/baldwin-agency/magento2-module-url-data-integrity-checker).
